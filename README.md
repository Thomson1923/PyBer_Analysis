# PyBer Analysis

# MEMORANDUM

# To:  V. Isualize
# From: Bob
# Re: Analysis of PyBer

# Overview of the analysis
## The following analysis provides quantitative and graphic information that describes the differences in various commercial metrics between our main geographical regions (urban, suburban, rural).

# Results
## Based on our analysis, we concluded that the Urban market remains our largest source of revenue despite the fact that fare per ride and fare collected per driver is below those of the other regions. The Rural market has the best growth prospect based on the superior fare per ride and the best region for recruiting additional drivers based on the average fare per driver.

# Recommendations
## We recommend that a cap should be placed on the number of drivers in the Urban region in order to maintain or increase the fares per drivers. We will have additional recommendations at a later date.
